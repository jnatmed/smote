```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

df = pd.read_csv('credit_dataset.csv')
df.head()

```
   

```{r iris}
iris = "~/UNLu/BasedeDatosMasivas/practica-2022/iris.csv"
summary(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
